Hello colleagues,<br/>
<br/>
at the moment it looks as if the artifactory has problems with the docker image size, the download stops after a certain time.<br/>
Until we have clarified the problem and released a solution, we ask for your understanding and patience.<br/>

Hello colleagues,<br/>
<br/>
we've added new content to the Docker's guide: http://github.conti.de/CTZS/Docker_Get_Started#preparations-for-usage-of-the-driveworks-docker-container-on-your-local-machine<br/>
<br/>
The new content (after 6.) is about how to setup your native Ubuntu machine with a DriveWorks docker image, so you can create docker containers for working with the DriveWorks.<br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:<br/>
<br/>
All docker images are still in development, in the beginning they will get frequently updated (library changes etc.).<br/>
If you miss any dependencies you can install it in your docker container, but send us (Florian Geis, Andreas Hauk, Steffen Schaack, Patrick Schnoell)<br/>
an info mail which dependency (i.e.: ProjectName - LibraryName - Version) we need to add to the docker images.<br/>

Hello colleagues,<br/>
<br/>
most of you got their Ubuntu (native or VM) already installed. (If you haven't yet, please do!).<br/>
The next step is to get the docker engine running and to download the docker images.<br/>
<br/>
For this step we prepared a GIT repository with all necessary infos.<br/>
Please clone this repository in your Ubuntu machine and follow the README.md.<br/>
<br/>
http://github.conti.de/CTZS/Docker_Get_Started<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have access to the CTZS organization, please ask your Domain/Project head to add you to their LDAP group and send us the group name so we can add them.<br/>
