What is a SharePoint site?<br/>
<br/>
A SharePoint site is a Web site that provides a central storage and collaboration space for documents, information, and ideas. A SharePoint site is a tool for collaboration, just like a telephone is a tool for communication, or a meeting is a tool for decision making. A SharePoint site helps groups of people (whether work teams or social groups) share information and work together. For example, a SharePoint site can help you: <br/>
<br/>
* Coordinate projects, calendars, and schedules.<br/>
* Discuss ideas and review documents or proposals.<br/>
* Share information and keep in touch with other people.<br/>
<br/>
SharePoint sites are dynamic and interactive -- members of the site can contribute their own ideas and content as well as comment on or contribute to other people's. <br/>
