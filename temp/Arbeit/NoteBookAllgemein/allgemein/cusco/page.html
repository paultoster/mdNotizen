Dear Matlab-User,<br/>
<br/>
on Tuesday, May the 5th 2015 we will execute a modification of the Option-File (which manages the access to the Licenses on the Server based on CUSCO).<br/>
To make sure that you will be able to access the needed Matlab Licenses (TMW_Matlab_Basic, TMW_Matlab_Toolboxes, TMW_Matlab_EmbeddedCoder), please...<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. &nbsp; &nbsp;...assigned your needed services in Cusco (http://abhe443a.cw01.contiwan.com/cusco/Default.aspx)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2. &nbsp; &nbsp;...maintained your location and Region in the Corporate Phonebook<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you use an account which is not in the active directory (e.g. atp001, ccfwradmin, heuerr, labuser, quail, system, tester, ubuntu or other) please get in contact with Juergen Sammet<br/>
<br/>
If you have any issues on this or the following days regarding licenses, please open a ticket of the support group AUTO S&amp;P WW LICENSE MANAGEMENT.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Jakob Schneider<br/>
